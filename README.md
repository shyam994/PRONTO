# PRONTO

PRONTO is an android application that calls for an ambulance whenever an accident is encountered. The user who has encountered an accident can call for the ambulance just by tapping a button in the application. The application then sends requests to all the ambulance services(service providers) online within that location where the accident took place. When any of the ambulance services accepts the request then the application shows the live location of the ambulance and the time required to reach the spot. Service providers register their ambulance service with the application and admin accepts the request only if it is legitimate.
